<!-- This is just going to be a really simple practice page :)  -->

<!-- Don't forget... header or head? 

 Ah, that's right. <head> is the tag that we always use at the top... what is it used for? :x
 <header> is a new tag for HMTL5 AND it is similar... it is used to hold the "heading" items and it is supposed to be used in place of a <div class="">        -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<hmtl>
    <head>
        <h2 class="title">Practice Here</h2>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
            First we will practice some Javascript.
            Nothing really tough right now. In fact I will
            do some really basic stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('hide').innerHTML = 'I tried but didn\'t succeed :)'">Hide</button>
            <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('hide').innerHTML = 'It works now :)  Just be really careful with quotations. The innerHTML = part MUST have single quotations. And, the entire onclick MUST have double quotations :x  This can be fairly confusing... look at how we can get around this. I know that we can use \ to show \'. I am not sure about double quotes... '">It Works</button>
            We can keep changing the same element :D
            
            <br/><br/>
            <!-- This button will be used to reset the hide id to what it was originally at :) -->
            <button type="button" onclick="">Reset</button>
            Right now this button does nothing.
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        <p id="hide">
            Push the button to change from Google to DuckDuckGo link.
            
            <br/>
            We can also hide elements :)
            
            <br/><br/>
            <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('changeLink').innerHTML = '<a href=http://www.duckduckgo.com>DuckDuckGo</a>'">I'm Feeling Quacky</button>
            <button type="button" onclick="getElementById('changeLink').style.display='none'">I'm not feeling it :x</button>
            
            <br/><br/>
            <a href="http://www.google.com" id="changeLink">Google</a>
            
            <br/><br/>
            Hmm, so this didn't really work haha. I am still unsure of how to use getElementById(). Keep trying though :)  Just follow the tutorial for a little while longer but keep trying stuff like this :)
            
            <br/><br/>
            So they DO work. I just <em class="special">REALLY</em> need to be careful with the quotations and single quotes... keep trying this out and keep practicing :)
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also change the CSS of the document OR of an id... well, changing the HTML so we can change the CSS of the whole document by changing the head I think.
            
            <br/><br/>
            <!-- Dark theme -->
            <button type="button" onclick="getElementById('changeCSS').style.backgroundColor='black', getElementById('changeCSS').style.color='darkGray'">Dark Theme</button>
            <!-- Red theme -->
            <button type="button" onclick="getElementById('changeCSS').style.backgroundColor='red', getElementById('changeCSS').style.color='pink'">Red Theme</button>
            <!-- Blue theme -->
            <button type="button" onclick="getElementById('changeCSS').style.backgroundColor='Blue', getElementById('changeCSS').style.color='lightBlue'">Blue Theme</button>
            <!-- Snow theme -->
            <button type="button" onclick="getElementById('changeCSS').style.backgroundColor='lightBlue', getElementById('changeCSS').style.color='white'">Snow Theme</button>
            <button type="button" onclick="getElementById('changeCSS').style.backgroundColor='white', getElementById('changeCSS').style.color='black'">White/Reset</button>
            
            <br/>
            Ah, careful cause if we change one part like text color but don't change it in another then we keep that styling... and it can lead to weird effects...
        <p/>
        <p id="changeCSS" >
            This is just some really basic editing... Notice something really interesting. Normally in CSS we would use font-style or background-color, use a hyphen for two letters. This is different here in Javascript. What we need to do is use upperCamel notation :)
            
            <br/><br/>
            It looks like "all" of Javascript uses upperCamel notation.
            
            <br/><br/>
            CSS: font-style
            <br/>
            Javascript= fontStyle
        </p>
        <p>
            This is really interesting :)  YES!! We can change multiple CSS "styles" by just using commas :D  Just don't forget that the onclick="" is what is actually doing the work and so we need to keep all of our code within the quotation marks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Move on
            <button >Next Page</button> <a href="practice1.html">NextPage</a>
            
            <br/>
            The link button is a little tougher than what I was expecting so for now just use a regular link.
        </p>
