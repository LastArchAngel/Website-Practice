A very basic HTML, and CSS website. I wish I could do more. Just do it :)  Seriously... If I really want to program some more and really get experience then I just have to do it :) So, Just do it.

This is going to be a Math website. I will do basic math... how basic though? This is literally basic... but a little more than just basic. I want to learn HTML and CSS... I don't want to get too deep into the actual math itself. Something along the line of equations, and what they actually mean... Use Mathematica :)  Give a little link and everything about Mathematica.

A plan on what I will talk about.

First a quick primer on set theory.
Functions in set theory... Nothing technical.
Then equations themselves.
Finding zeros.
Solving for systems of linear equations: simple, ax + b, and cx + d. That simple.
Solving for systems of Non-linear equations but just basic stuff like polynomials: ax^2 + b, and cx +d.

I think that is if for this one :)

How do I add different pages though?
Each of the above can technically be a different page by itself.

I can also have a small intro into Mathematica.

Actually, Do the HW basically :)

It will give me a lot of practice and I will actually be doing work :))  So, how do I use Amazon's service? Can I put my data into the AWS database actually haha. I am going to try :)  But I really need to do the HW first and foremost.
