A very basic HTML, and CSS website. I wish I could do more. Just do it :)  Seriously... If I really want to program some more and really get experience then I just have to do it :) So, Just do it.

I will use Mathematica to do my HW and learn HTML, CSS, and hopefully Javascript.

Really basic stuff... Just basically go through the HW and figure all of this stuff out slowly.

I do have time.

First work on distrubutions... ONLY work on the HW and try not to stray unless I really don't know what I am doing and I really need to practice. Kind of like the Reap and Sow functions... I may just basically "copy" his code and work from there. But, I am really trying to figure all of this out :x
